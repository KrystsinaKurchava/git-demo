Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
On this their chosen battlefield



Fear will not pierce our hearts, the searching arrows wound
Victory is our reward for all the blood we spilled
We didn’t come to waste our lives, like pawns in a savage game
Our spirits, shieldss and spears are linked in a much stronger chain

March as one, don’t look back
Oden’s sons: attack!

All are one and one is all
Side by side the battle calls
All are one and one is all
Shield by shield we’ll never fall

Unleash hell, do not repent
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear
